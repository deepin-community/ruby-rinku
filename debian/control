Description: autolinker for Ruby
 Rinku is a Ruby library that does autolinking.
 .
 It parses text and turns anything that remotely resembles a link into an HTML
 link, just like the Ruby on Rails `auto_link` method -- but it's about 20
 times faster, because it's written in C, and it's about 20 times smarter when
 linking, because it does actual parsing instead of RegEx replacements.
